# 🌍 LinguaMate — Learn Languages Interactively

LinguaMate is a simple, interactive language learning web application built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project is based on my **own concept** and is created as a **personal learning tool** while I am learning new languages myself. I wanted to build something that can also help other beginners practice vocabulary, grammar, tenses, phrases, and quizzes in a clean and interactive way.

> ⚠️ This is just the **first version (concept stage)**.  
> In the future, this project can be enhanced with more languages, more levels, and even an AI chatbot for language assistance.

## 💭 How This Idea Started

Initially, my goal was to build an **AI chatbot for language learning** where users could practice conversations and solve grammar problems interactively.

However, due to limited resources:

- I do not have access to paid OpenAI APIs
- Hugging Face models were too slow and heavy to run in real time
- Running local models on my PC was not possible due to low hardware specifications

Because of these practical limitations, I decided to build this **frontend interactive language learning web app** as the first step of the idea.

This project represents the **foundation** of what can later grow into a complete AI-powered language learning platform.

## 🤖 Development Process

While building this project, I used the help of different AI chatbots and online resources to understand concepts, improve code structure, and solve issues. This helped me learn faster and build this project more efficiently as a student.
